Build your project with the matrix.c file.
Use the "Matrix" definition, do not work with the structure, unless you know what you are doing.
You can find the determinant, minor, cofactor, adjoint and inverse of any matrix as long as it's possible. (Unless there's a bug)
Do not forget to free the memory after defining a matrix. (All values of the matrix lies in the dynamic memory.)
This is a hobby project (obviously), so do not expect professionalism.
